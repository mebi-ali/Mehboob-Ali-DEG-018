# Description

## Docker Task

Peter is a developer and currently he requires a containerised environment. He needs a python environment in which pandas, numpy, seaborn and sklearn are installed for specified versions and he also requires a conformation message to be displayed on the console showing that specified versions of the dependencies have been sucessfully installed. The containerized environment should be running in the background. Another constraint is that the only port available on the host side is "7059".
following are the specified version for libraries.
    1. Pandas:
	    Version 1.2.2
    2. NumPy:
	    Version 1.18.5
    3. Seaborn:
	    Version 0.9.0
    4. Scikit-learn:
	    Version 0.23.2
PS : Ensure best practices are followed and containerised environment should be persistent.
